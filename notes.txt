Ping-Pong Controller is a simple Spring Boot REST API controller that provides a basic ping-pong response when accessed.
A record is a special type used for immutable data structures. This record defines a response model with a single field result.
It can be used in load balancers or monitoring tools to check if the backend service is running. Example: Kubernetes liveness probes use /ping endpoints. This can be extended to track user activity or API usage.

Fork → If you want your own copy of a repo on GitHub and make changes independently.
Clone → If you just want a local copy of a repo (but can't push unless you have permission).

Docker isolates all content, code, and data in a container from your local filesystem. This means, that when you delete a container within Docker Desktop, all the content within it is deleted. Sometimes you may want to persist data that a container generated. This is when you can use volumes.

Sometimes you may want the container to access a directory on your system. This is when you use bind mounts.
doker/bindmount-apps/compose.yaml:
todo-app:
    # ...
    volumes:
      - ./app:/usr/src/app
      - /usr/src/app/node_modules
The volumes element tells Compose to mount the local folder ./app to /usr/src/app in the container for the todo-app service. This particular bind mount overwrites the static contents of the /usr/src/app directory in the container and creates what is known as a development container. The second instruction, /usr/src/app/node_modules, prevents the bind mount from overwriting the container's node_modules directory to preserve the packages installed in the container.
